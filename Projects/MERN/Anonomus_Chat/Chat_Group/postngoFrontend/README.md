# PostNGo Project

Welcome to the PostNGo Project - a stress-free platform for students to ask questions.     
This project is split into two main parts: `postngoFrontend` and `postngoBackend`. The front-end is built with React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface. The back-end is an Express server using Mongoose for MongoDB integration, handling all the data magic.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `npm` installed on your machine. If not, [follow these instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install Node.js and npm.

### Installing

#### Setting up the Backend

Navigate to the `postngoBackend` directory:
```bash
cd postngoBackend
```
Install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```
Start the server (runs on `http://localhost:8000`):
```bash
npm start
```

### Setting up the Frontend
Open a new terminal and switch to the postngoFrontend directory:
```bash
cd postngoFrontend
```
Install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```
Run the React app (runs on `http://localhost:3000`):
```bash
npm start
```

The front-end should now be up and running, communicating with your back-end.

### Usage
After starting both the front-end and back-end, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

### Built With
React - The web framework used for the front-end
